	 	I'm a second year computer science major at Rochester Institute of Technology. I started to code
		because growing up, I played a lot of video games. The first time I hacked a game with a
		game shark wasn't until high school and that was the first time I ever saw source code. To me, it was
		interesting that something with such a complex story and game play mechanics was entirely controlled 
		by 1s and 0s. It wasn't until my senior year that I would even consider a career in Computer Science.
		I had always been dead set in being a graphic designer for video games. That changed when I took my
		first Java course senior year. Since then, Computer Science has shown me that I can build so much more
		than just games. With code, the only limit is your imagination. I want to be able to help others 
		and this is why I code.
